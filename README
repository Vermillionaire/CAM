Implimentation of a Categorical Abstract Machine (CAM) in SML

Basic information on CAM's:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_abstract_machine

(*It currently does not compile*)
To run the machine you will need to install SML, then run "sml CAM.sml"

The program takes in a text file called code.txt which contains the compiled code for the machine.
Make sure the file is in the same directory as CAM.sml

When the code is successfully read into the machine, type command execute() to run it.
There are two different example programs provided called code.txt and code1.txt.
To run code1.txt, change its name to code.txt.
